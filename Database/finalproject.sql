(3, 'Chapter 2 Steve\'s Ultimatum', 6, '<p>It was raining again the following Tuesday, although the threatening thunder had made a tactical withdrawal for the time being, and the light wasn\'t good, especially under the ornamental cherry trees that seemed to close in at the sides of the road further down the hill, making the pavement slippery with their carelessly discarded blossoms. There were a few houses here, large Victorian villas with big gardens, probably built for merchants who had done unspeakable things in the East or West Indies, and now occupied by the secretive bankers and lawyers who were only glimpsed in the village if they accidentally left their car windows down when driving to or from work in Edinburgh. Christopher had never really questioned the lack of community spirit in the little town, but thinking about it now as they headed towards the old higgledy-piggledy fishermen\'s houses down by the river, he realised the place was divided into two or three sections, with the riverside dwellers resenting the people in the newer estates up the hill, and both resenting the inhabitants of the Victorian villas. He had a sudden twinge of guilt about not being able to bring the factions together into a coalition under the umbrella of the Forum, but as always he brushed the guilt aside, telling himself he had done all he could, and it wasn\'t his fault if the people around here were born awkward.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>He felt self-conscious now in the scruffy old leather jacket, as if he were guilty of attempting to appear younger and more cool than he really was, although he realised it probably had the opposite effect. Nothing more embarrassing than an ageing rocker, after all. He wondered briefly whether to put on his scruffy brown tweed one instead, but decided against it. The brown tweed jacket was definitely the jacket of an archivist, and now that he was no longer a member of that profession he felt as if he wasn\'t entitled to wear it. Christopher had resolved a long time ago not to try to be something he wasn\'t - if only he could instead be proud of what he was, but that was out of the question these days. Anyway, if Amaryllis mistook him for someone young and cool that was her problem.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'It\'s just down here on the left,\' called Amaryllis from the back of the group. \'Turn along Merchantman Wynd.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>The street was a cul de sac once notorious for its ladies of the night plying their trade in the shadows but now more famous for its award-winning mews-style town houses. This was all new to Christopher; he couldn\'t remember when he had last come along here, and now he stared in puzzlement at the twee balconies and incongruous Mediterranean white washed walls and brightly coloured creeping plants. How sad that some people weren\'t satisfied with the Scottish grey stone, off-white net curtains and statutory patch of grass that distinguished the houses in most towns along the coast.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'So tell me, \' said Steve Paxman in a pleasant tone that very nearly concealed the hint of the KGB-style interrogation techniques that were undoubtedly at his disposal. \'I\'m guessing you have all the paperwork for PLIF in place - written constitution, accounts, policies. I\'m sure you\'re the kind of person who would be meticulous about it all.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other areas of his life Christopher was indeed a very meticulous man, but he had considered the Forum as a red-tape-free zone, a haven where he could relax in the knowledge that nobody would ever come looking for paperwork.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'I am quite meticulous,\' he admitted, playing for time and wondering all over again why exactly Steve Paxman was so interested in this small local organisation. \'But I\'m not sure that I can lay my hands on every last document... not off the top of my head....\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'Turn into the yard here,\' called Amaryllis, unexpectedly coming to his rescue. \'On the right - look for the orange door.\'<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Amaryllis\'s \'yard\' was a wilderness surrounding a tumbledown structure - it would surely have been an exaggeration to call it a building. The faded orange door was attached to its frame by one hinge. A beech tree in the centre of the wilderness had been allowed to run wild and one of its branches now extended through a gap in a window. The tree probably supported its own eco-system. Curiously, though, Christopher noticed that even before any of them had set foot in the place the tall grass had been flattened in places and that a very rough path led through it towards the back of the structure. Vandals, he thought dismissively, or school kids. Same thing really. He immediately felt cross with himself for spending too much time with Jock McLean and absorbing his attitudes.<p>', 0),

I couldn\'t seem to calm myself down though, as much as I tried. I absolutely hated flying. And an eleven-hour flight to Paris was the last thing I wanted to be doing the day before Christmas Eve. But my mother had begged me to come spend the holidays with her and her new husband. I know that she only invited me out of guilt. I hadn\'t seen my mother in over five years and she seemed to have no problem leaving me behind after my dad got sick, so the fact that she was inviting me to come see her now really pissed me off. It only took her one year to get remarried and one more to have a kid. She completely cut me and my dad off, acting as if we never existed.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I had no one else. So Paris was my only option.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting through security was easier than I thought it was going to be and I actually found my gate without much trouble. But even with all this good luck, I still couldn\'t help but feel uneasy. I had only flown two other times in my life, both for reasons I wish I could\'ve avoided. The first time was for my grandmother\'s funeral in Florida and the second was for my mother\'s wedding in Paris to a man that I had never met before, a man that was not my father.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, not only was flying absolutely terrifying, it also almost always delivered me into an unwanted situation. I knew that this flight wouldn\'t be any different.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>I waited to board the flight for about half an hour. I wanted to be early just to be sure I wouldn\'t miss it. I did not want to have to pay for another flight.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once on the airplane, I couldn\'t keep my hands from shaking. One of the flight attendants smiled at me as I walked past her and, obviously noticing my nervousness, giving me a reassuring nod.

I couldn\'t seem to calm myself down though, as much as I tried. I absolutely hated flying. And an eleven-hour flight to Paris was the last thing I wanted to be doing the day before Christmas Eve. But my mother had begged me to come spend the holidays with her and her new husband. I know that she only invited me out of guilt. I hadn\'t seen my mother in over five years and she seemed to have no problem leaving me behind after my dad got sick, so the fact that she was inviting me to come see her now really pissed me off. It only took her one year to get remarried and one more to have a kid. She completely cut me and my dad off, acting as if we never existed.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I had no one else. So Paris was my only option.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting through security was easier than I thought it was going to be and I actually found my gate without much trouble. But even with all this good luck, I still couldn\'t help but feel uneasy. I had only flown two other times in my life, both for reasons I wish I could\'ve avoided. The first time was for my grandmother\'s funeral in Florida and the second was for my mother\'s wedding in Paris to a man that I had never met before, a man that was not my father.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, not only was flying absolutely terrifying, it also almost always delivered me into an unwanted situation. I knew that this flight wouldn\'t be any different.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>I waited to board the flight for about half an hour. I wanted to be early just to be sure I wouldn\'t miss it. I did not want to have to pay for another flight.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once on the airplane, I couldn\'t keep my hands from shaking. One of the flight attendants smiled at me as I walked past her and, obviously noticing my nervousness, giving me a reassuring nod. I tried my best to return the smile.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>I took deep breaths as I walked across the airport, luggage in tow. I couldn\'t seem to calm myself down though, as much as I tried.

He was perched on the edge of his seat, his clenched hands well on the way to ruining the brim of his hat. His Adam\'s apple bobbed nervously.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivian blew a perfect smoke ring through pursed red lips and frowned. She studied him for a moment before shifting her feet off the heavy desk and stubbing out her cigarette. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Say that again?\" she asked.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Nigel is innocent!\" insisted the young man. His voice began to rise. \"He\'s a civilised man. Sensitive. He would never hit someone on the head like that, not with a spanner! All that blood!\" he shuddered.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivian looked at the paper again. \"It says here the police have an eyewitness,\" she said flatly.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"They can\'t have, it must be a mistake.\" The young man swallowed. \"Nigel had no motive. Despite what the papers say, he wasn\'t her lover.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivian raised a sceptical eyebrow. A blush rose in the cheeks of the young man opposite, but he continued to meet her gaze. \"Maybe not,\" she conceded, \"But he was caught with a gold snuff box in his pocket. Robbery could be motive enough!\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"It was a gift!\" protested her would-be-client. \"My aunt loved to dance. Nigel is an elegant dancer and sometimes he would escort her to dances. She promised it to him, as a token of her thanks.\" His cheeks were now scarlet. \"I am her sole heir, and I say it was a gift.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivian turned her eyes back to the newspaper. Who was the investigating officer? A flicker of interest crossed her face for the first time. It was her old nemesis, Inspector Felix. A picture of his foxhound face and toothbrush moustache rose into her mind. She remembered the last time they had crossed paths, when he had dared to call her \"love\" and told her to go home and stop meddling in police business. She ground her teeth at the memory. The nerve of the man! Which one of them worked undercover for the government during the war, for heaven\'s sake?<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until that moment, Vivian had been going to regretfully decline.

Despite what the papers say, he wasn\'t her lover.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivian raised a sceptical eyebrow. A blush rose in the cheeks of the young man opposite, but he continued to meet her gaze. \"Maybe not,\" she conceded, \"But he was caught with a gold snuff box in his pocket. Robbery could be motive enough!\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"It was a gift!\" protested her would-be-client. \"My aunt loved to dance. Nigel is an elegant dancer and sometimes he would escort her to dances. She promised it to him, as a token of her thanks.\" His cheeks were now scarlet. \"I am her sole heir, and I say it was a gift.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vivian turned her eyes back to the newspaper. Who was the investigating officer? A flicker of interest crossed her face for the first time. It was her old nemesis, Inspector Felix. A picture of his foxhound face and toothbrush moustache rose into her mind. She remembered the last time they had crossed paths, when he had dared to call her \"love\" and told her to go home and stop meddling in police business. She ground her teeth at the memory. The nerve of the man! Which one of them worked undercover for the government during the war, for heaven\'s sake?<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until that moment, Vivian had been going to regretfully decline. It seemed the case was open and shut and she didn\'t want to take a punter\'s money for nothing. She had some standards, after all. end!!!<p>', 0),

(11, 'Part 1', 8, '<p>Was this the most exciting thing ever to happen? It must at least be one of the most exciting!<p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Dr Thomas Clark it was positively the best moment of his life, something he will remember to the end of his days. However like everything in this life, exactly how exciting (or not) something was, came entirely down to perspective.  All the books in the world wouldn\'t be the slightest bit of interest to someone who couldn\'t read, the true value of their existence wasted on unattuned eyes. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are you a proud soldier, fighting to liberate a frightened population from their cruel overlords? Or are you a faceless drone of the foreign invader, who has come to destroy the local peoples way of life? It depends where you\'re standing when you ask the question. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>So a scientific discovery such as this one, that immediately rises to one of the best, most exciting things ever for a man like Dr Thomas Clark, wouldn\'t turn any heads at a primary school for example. With the colour of what pen to use next, being the much more important question on the youngsters minds. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Clark however, was a man of science, an astrophysicist to be precise, and this discovery was not at all wasted on him. It was the most important he had ever made. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pulling up his collar up against the heavy rain and bitterly cold wind, he galloped energetically towards the front door of a rather expensive looking home. Following the stark outdoor lighting fixtures that lined the front drive, while dodging the various flowers that encased the pathway, he came to a grinding halt outside a thick wooden door. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wind had been picking up all night and it had finally sapped all the heat from his body. He was freezing, soaked through and because of his avoidance to driving, exhausted. He had practically ran the entire  three miles it was from his lab to the door he now stood in front of, having stopped only momentarily when he thought he was going to pass out. Despite all this however nothing could wipe the smile from his face. He battered on the door, impatiently waiting to meet the occupant inside. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Thomas Clark was in many ways a stereo-typical being. Having a very (how shall I put this?) different personality to most, he was very easy to label. On top of this, the fact that he dressed like a cartoon character that had come to life; wearing the classic lab coat and brown slacks more often than not, made him fit into the awkward scientist category very nicely. As well as looking like a perfect model for \"Laboratory safety equipment monthly\" he had never really in all his years managed to get a good understanding of people. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their strange obsession with social interaction and how they very rarely thought of the grand picture had always been a massive obstacle for him to overcome. As a result he would avoid social situations whenever possible. Taking the time to continue with his research instead, and then when he did indeed have to socialise, he remained as mute as possible. All of this made forming positive relationships rather difficult. People and their complex emotions (that as far as he could tell) seemed to have very little logic or structure to them whatsoever; continuously changing or updating as they pleased. One day they were happy and the next they were sad. One day entertained, the next, bored out of their mind. It just didn\'t make any sense! <p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seemed the main problem was Thomas couldn\'t predict them. People and their pesky emotions. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas liked knowing things before hand, having plans that could be kept to in a timely manner for almost everything he did. Even on his days off, where any normal person would just do as they please, Thomas felt the desire to have a weekend checklist. A series of productive tasks (usually housework) that had to be completed before the sun went down and only then could he relax. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was one of the reasons he fell in love with astrophysics, the precise movement and position of the stars and their surrounding planets being mathematically predictable. He took a great deal of pride and comfort in knowing exactly how an object of mind-boggling mass and size was going to behave. With the exception of tonight, his life was a regimented and predictable ensemble.<p>', 0),
(12, 'Part 2', 8, '<p>\"Well I must say even for someone like me, that does sound intriguing.\" William added as he sat down opposite Thomas, handing the nervous man his own drink, before sitting back and taking a sip of the golden brown liquid himself. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas meanwhile, didn\'t sit back. His elbows were on his knees, his free hand was frantically fumbling around with his chin in an attempt to calm his thoughts. After a short while however he gulped down a mouthful for the same reason.  <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"So...\" William coaxed with a smile on his face. \"Are you going to tell me?\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>After taking another gulp Thomas locked eyes with William and composed himself. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Because of the complex  nature of this topic, and since I don\'t know how much you know about astrophysics or even science in general, I feel it\'s logical to start from the beginning and work my way up, so that you can follow along.\" <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"That makes sense.\" William agreed. Again with that warm smile that seemed to calm even the most distressed of souls.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Ok so.\" Thomas began. \"Despite your lack of interest in science, even you will know, the world we live on, all the animals and plants, all the stars in the sky and indeed everything in the known universe is made up of matter. Plain old ordinary matter that forms the building blocks of everything.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Well I\'m glad you have finally realised that fact old friend! I\'m glad that brings you such happiness!\" William chuckled, pleased with his little joke. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas didn\'t react, this was no time for jokes. He continued as if nothing had happened.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Well, alongside this \"normal\" matter, and I use the term \"normal\" because it comes down to perspective, there is also Anti-matter.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>A spark of recognition ignited in Williams mind.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Yes, yes I remember you talking about this before! Atoms that have different properties than normal...they have a different electric charge or something around that area? In the same way two ends of a magnet have different charges?\" William queried, taking another sip from his glass. Thomas meanwhile was quite surprised William had recalled anything about his last lecture, he had always assumed that his friend forgot almost everything the moment Thomas left the room. So this unexpected amount of retention did come as a pleasant surprise. It was nice to be on at least a similar page as his best friend, it made a change from the normal difficulties they had faced throughout their time together.   <p>\r\n\r\n<p>As children Thomas would spend his days reading scientific journals until he found something that intrigued him. He would then enthuse to William endlessly about the latest theory or most recent findings. Explaining both how and why those finding were made. Meanwhile William was more bothered about his new shoes or fancy new watch, not really listening to Thomas rant on.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>This caused some tension between them initially, as Thomas would get frustrated with Williams lax attitude. The workings of the universe being, from his perspective, much more important than the logo that was on printed on your top. Eventually however, Thomas began to accept his friend\'s different outlook, deciding it was better to have a slightly disconnected friend then none at all. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this recollection came as a bit of a shock, and Thomas was quite proud of him. He just hoped to high heaven that William remembered what he was going to tell him next. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Yes along those lines, Anti-matter has the exact opposite charge to normal matter but the same mass; a sort of mirror image of each other. A hydrogen atom that is made up of one neutron, one electron and one proton, will have the same atomic weight of an anti-matter hydrogen atom that is made up of the anti-matter equivalents. Protons have a positive charge and electrons have a negative charge, the anti-matter copies have the corresponding opposites.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>END<p>', 0),
(13, 'Part 3', 8, '<p>Both men sat in silence for a moment, allowing the thick air to settle as Thomas\'s shocking words bounced around only to slowly fade away and be replaced by the gentle pitter-patter of rain on the windows. Thomas was impressed with his friend, normally he would of trailed off by now, going to get another drink or something to eat in order to get the conversation moving in a different direction, but Thomas could tell by the staring look on Williams face he was deeply invested, how could he not be? <p>\r\n\r\n<p>William was sat forward in his chair staring into space, processing, and coming to terms with what he had just been told. This idea that the universe had yet another layer to it. A completely new building block that filled in the gaps between everything else, that until now, had passed by unseen. Suddenly his world seemed even smaller that it had before, a tiny point lost in a sea of matter where even the empty bits had something in them. Thomas took it upon himself to carry on explaining as it was clear William was in no position to retort. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"This device, I won\'t bother you with the details of how it works, but for explanations sake you can think of it as a special kind of telescope, a \"Dark matter\" telescope if you will. I did consider calling it \"An Invisible telescope\" but that doesn\'t have the same ring to it and sends out a confusing message I feel. However I digress, this Dark matter, as well as having its own equivalent to our atoms, the basic building blocks for anything solid. It also has its own equivalent to our light or photons; the particles that make up all radio, infa-red, visible light and ultraviolet waves. This means there is a complete Dark electromagnetic spectrum out there, unable to be detected by any device except mine. My telescope can detect this spectrum and transfer it into a usable format. Just like a normal telescope would pick up normal light coming from a distant star, my Dark telescope can pick up all the Dark light coming from the Dark stars. It then converts what it picks up into an image.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concerned that his friend was struggling to follow along Thomas paused, giving William time to gather his thoughts. Expecting a barrage of \"What do you mean?\" or \"Can you explain that bit again?\" type of questions to come firing at him. like a verbal machine gun. However William remained deadly silent. Staring off into the void as if he could see all this Dark matter himself.  After  a few moments he then in a clam, relaxed tone asked a rather simple question. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"And what does this stuff look like?\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>This might at first glance seem like a stupid question when you are talking about an invisible substance, the initial response being to say, its invisible! So it doesn\'t look like anything!\" but when you really think about it, its probably one of the most though provoking questions to ask. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>This took Thomas off guard, with all the respect in the world, William wasn\'t the brightest of men and such an unexpected question seemed to be above his normal intellect. It was a fantastic question that Thomas himself hadn\'t really considered. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his telescope\'s converted images were incredibly basic; having no colour and only being able to showing the contrast of light and shade, like taking a rather blurry black and white photo, it was indeed hard to know what this stuff would actually look like if you could see it.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine standing on a block  of this Dark matter with a set of eye balls that where attuned to detect the Dark light coming off it. What would you see? Would it look the same as an ordinary piece of matter? Or would it look extremely different? Would a collection of Dark carbon atoms look the same as normal carbon? Would a Dark matter rock have the same rough, hard and unforgiving matt surface of a normal matter equivalent? Thomas had always imagined it would look the same as normal matter, but now he was properly thinking about it, not letting his own excitement cloud his vision, there was no definitive reason why it had to look anything like the ordinary matter he had come to know and love. There was too much unknown about the composition of this substance to make a justified comment either way.  <p>\r\n\r\n<p>END!!!<p>', 0),

The man appears with a coat as dark as night hiding his grey suit and a white flower peeping out of his pocket. His dark curly hair and red eyes glisten in the street lamp giving him the spot light.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unknown Reader: His name is Llama MacCarones more known as the Professor at the Witchcraft and Wizardry Magical Arts Approval House and has taught up to 107 Witches. No witch or wizard throughout the whole country knew why his appearance started at a Orphanage but it created a new beginning to an Untold Story.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Unknown Reader\'s voice echoes away and footsteps tapping on wet concrete make a sudden appearance; black and red decorated shoes walk into a puddle and stop infront of a black gate with a plaque in the middle:<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the plaque rests an Elder mansion with dark grey bricks lining the walls like a Haunted House. The windows watch like a Bold Eagle most with cracks or close to their smashing point others with cobwebs infested with the dangerous Black Widow. Every splat and squeak his boots make while creeping closer and closer towards the house, his grey gloves reaching past his head to unlock the door without even touching it. As he walks inside the walls decorated with dark floral wallpaper and the edgy corridor lined with creaky wood floorboards make up the reception at the corner of the reception is a dark-wooden desk with a petite woman. Her freckles, glasses and ginger hair tied in a bun tells the man that she is a smart but serious girl. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Girl puts a hand under the table to reach for something - something heavy and brings her hand back up with at least five hundred pieces of paper, flicking through all of them Llama can notice troubled kids, abandoned kids, homeless kids etc until it lands on Mr. Samiskowski. The Number #445 is marked with deep black ink meaning he is a Troubled Kid, underneath the Number lies Unknown Parents aswell as a Picture of a young 7 year old boy with another 7 year old girl. Llama quickly looks back at the girl and smiles as she leaves from her tiny desk with the paperwork clutched to her chest. They waddle down a corridor and Llama looks inside some of the rooms containing Orphans; the children staring right back. By the time they reach the far end of The Western Wing the girl steps back and unlocks the big silver door while from afar. Llama takes a step inside and looks at the 16 year old man hiding behind his knees, Llama waves his hand and the girl faints falling on the floor like a glass.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Samiskowski: You\'re here for me aren\'t you?<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Llama MacCarones: Yes but for the right reasons. I am not a Doctor, I am a Professor who studies those with... unique talents.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Samiskowski: They all laughed at me here. I could make animals hurt themselves, the wind make them fly away and make objects move without touching them. They called me a Freak.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Samiskowski carries on talking but it fuzzes into a memory.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Samiskowski Real Life: The Matrons took us to Erie for a day away from the Orphanage. They thought it was a good idea to bring everyone. When we were all there most of the matrons just cared about their tans and left us to play in the playground.<p>', 0),

Anything.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>One drink and she\'d be good as new, ready to face another day of re-boarding the windows. Of breaking doors into wood for warmth and light. Of ransacking the cafeteria next door. Of roaming around endlessly the once-crowded-now-deserted halls of Kennedy High in that perpetual seesaw she lived now, oscillating from bored to terrified to bored to terrified, depending on the weather.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not that the weather was ever good. But there were several levels of bad. Several instances of the Storm, ranging from I-might-die\' to I\'m-probably-gonna-die\' to \'I\'m-definitely-gonna-die\'. Tonight, the rain was somewhere between the two last options.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>She closed her eyes and listened to the thunderclapping of the raindrops, loud like bugs smashing against the glass pane over her head. A distant thud informed her that a window board had given in, somewhere on the other side of the building.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Welcome, Ghosts,\" she said. \"Please, make yourselves at home.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a joke, the kind she had to tell herself every so often to keep the fear at bay.

Tongue flashing in and out of its mouth every couple of seconds as if checking for food.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"Yeah, I\'m hungry too,\" Marylou said. The snake bluff charged her. She didn\'t flinch. \"What?

It flew away and smashed the wall. \"Neither do black olives.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>He looked up at Ray, expecting a reaction. Out. Head down against the table, mouth open against his arm, still holding on to the Pepsi bottle.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"You know, that\'s what I like the most about sharing this place with you,\" Dean said, leaning back and grabbing a slice of the Meat Lovers. \"The company.\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upstairs, Wyatt was asleep too, Dean was sure. The old man was always asleep, even when it wasn\'t – he checked the clock – four in the morning.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dean didn\'t like sleeping. From a young age, he had come to see time as a currency, and sleep as tax. He cherished his awake time as precious and scarce, something to hold on to for as long as possible. The way he saw things, every hour asleep was an hour less of life he\'d never get back.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Vanessa, his voluntary insomnia was all the more reinforced. Our time in this life is limited enough as it is without forgoing a third of it to the blurry realm of the unconscious mind.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>A thud brought Dean\'s eyes to the glass doors. He got up. A shoe. The toecap spread and tore open, no laces, banging against the glass with every new gush of wind outside.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhere, someone\'s barefoot. Dean was ready to sit back down when his eyes stopped on the neon sign outside, by the hinges. The \'D\' in Desmond\'s Pizza Place was dead-dark. Blown up fuse.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>He dragged himself to the glass doors and pulled the lock open. \"The world is ending, Dean,\" he heard. Ray, eyes half-open, head still against the tabletop, drawled, \"You don\'t need to fix the sign every time it breaks.\" Dean shrugged. \"What will the regulars think?\"<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ray\'s eyes fell closed again. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dean stepped outside, bracing against the wind. The restaurant was incrusted against the back wall of a roofed alleyway sided by two mostly destroyed three-story building. Once a little hidden paradise of used bookstores and benches and even a fountain where people would drop coins and make wishes, the alley was now pretty much in ruins. All the front stores had perished in the first week, fallen victims of the Storm, and most of the others had been abandoned soon after, and now time and the constant rain were already starting to take its toll on them. But not Desmond\'s Pizza Place. The strategic position of the restaurant, at the very end of the cobblestone pathway, coped with Dean\'s fatherly dedication to keeping the place up and running no matter what, worked together to make it the last standing pizza place in California, and maybe the world.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dean blinked the rain spray from his eyes and reached for the sign and pulled it down from its brackets. He turned, eyes half-shut against the wind, to face the rain hammering mercilessly on the sidewalk thirty feet away. Always. Always raining, not a day, not a minute of rest. The gutter in front of the alley was a constant river of rapid waters shin-high, strong enough to pull a grown man down to whatever urban ocean it flowed to. Car doors, clothes, chairs and wooden debris that once were houses were common vessels of the stream. In the worst days, the whole street would turn river, and Dean would sit with Ray and Wyatt by the door, the three of them side by side like a movie theater crowd, watching through the glass as rolling waves reached closer and closer and the water level rose, all three in silent wondering of if and when the Storm was coming for them at last. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>He stepped back into the restaurant, rested the sign on the table and locked the door behind him and puffed his cheeks. He\'d try to fix the sign in the morning. If he couldn\'t, he\'d paint a new one on plywood and hang that over the glass doors. Either way, Desmond\'s would not go without proper fronting for more than a night. <p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way Dean figured, we all need a reason to be alive. Kids, a job, a call from God.

The generator was working fine tonight, and that\'s what mattered.

(18, 'Chapter 3 Building a Community Strategy and other Stories', 6, '<p><p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'You\'re all taking a big step forward in deciding to build a community strategy, and I want you to give yourselves a huge round of applause,\' said Steve Paxman, leaning over the conference table in the big impersonal meeting room he had hired at the Holiday Inn Pitkirtly. Christopher had never set foot in the place before, although his sister Caroline was a member of the health club here and visited at least once every six months to get value for money out of her three hundred pounds a year subscription.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a stunned silence from the members of PLIF, most of whom, as Christopher was well aware, had not suspected themselves of deciding to build a community strategy. Young Dave poured a glass of water and sipped at it, while Mrs Stevenson stared out of the window at the view of the tarmac car park outside or perhaps at the Lomond Hills in the distance.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'We don\'t do that kind of thing here, Mr Paxman,\' said Big Dave.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'Come on, Davie, I thought I asked you to call me Steve. We\'re all on the same side, after all.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'Stalin was on the same side as us once,\' said Big Dave, tactful as ever. \'And it\'s Dave, not Davie. Davie\'s a diminutive and I find it patronising and insulting.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'I\'m sorry, Dave,\' said Steve, floundering a bit but making a reasonable recovery. \'So - let\'s get on with building the strategy then!\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>To Christopher\'s ears it sounded much the same as \'let\'s all jump out of an aeroplane, then\' or even \'let\'s all go and jump off a cliff like the lemmings we are\', except that he was sure he had read recently that lemmings didn\'t really jump off cliffs. Jock McLean sucked on his empty pipe, daring Steve to invoke the non-smoking policy of the hotel, and glared alternately at Christopher, whom he blamed, somewhat unfairly, for starting the whole thing, and Amaryllis, who was sitting shuffling papers and as an outsider would be the automatic scapegoat, should one be needed.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'So - what are our aims in building this strategy?\' Steve had now produced a big piece of paper, which he unrolled on the table in front of him. It was completely blank so far. \'Amaryllis, would you hand out the Post-Its, please?\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'Here you go,\' said Amaryllis, handing round little clumps of the garish sticky notes. Please God, don\'t let him ask us to write a strategy on a Post-It, thought Christopher, surprising himself by his inner desperation.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'It\'s amazing what you can get on one of these,\' said Steve, waving around a little bundle of bright blue ones. Christopher had deep pink, and he could see that Big Dave was embarrassed by the pale pink pile in front of him.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'I\'ve heard tell there are monks who can write the whole Harry Potter saga on one of those,\' observed Jock McLean. Steve gave him a hard look. Christopher waited for Jock to say \'Ooo, I\'m really scared\', but fortunately he didn\'t.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'I\'d like you to write on one of your Post-Its what you think is the one thing this strategy will achieve,\' said Steve. \'Then we\'ll stick them all on this big piece of paper here and that will enable us to discuss it in more detail.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other circumstances Christopher might have enjoyed playing around with Post-Its, sticking bits of paper together, and drawing in different colours, but not in present company. He could see Jock apparently doodling. Amaryllis had written what looked like a chapter of a novel on hers, but then she thought better of it, scrunched up the first one and threw it in her bag, and wrote just a few words on the new one.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>He thought about what he would like to achieve, and the first answer that came to him was that he wanted things to move forward extremely slowly, at a snail\'s pace, so that the movement was imperceptible and painless to everyone. He hastily wrote \'research and consultation\' on the Post-It - when it came to delaying things, these were definitely top of the list. Consulting everybody in the town would take months, if not years - even working out how to consult would take some time. Christopher brightened up a little. He smiled at Amaryllis, whom he hadn\'t spoken to since mentioning the kids. It was a pity he hadn\'t got the chance to tell her the full story, but if his delaying tactics worked, they would have all the time in the world to talk about these things.<p>', 0);

(19, '\r\nChapter 4 You say gorilla and I say guerilla', 6, '<p>Chapter 4 You say gorilla and I say guerilla<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'So it\'s war,\' said Christopher a few days later in the Queen of Scots. \'Only we don\'t have any generals, or big guns, or any equipment for that matter.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>He had mulled over the situation after leaving the Holiday Inn. PLIF - his group of friends - their cosy evenings in the Queen of Scots - Steve Paxman\'s vaguely threatening manner and proposal to involve the local council in something they had no right to get involved in - and he had decided to make a stand. It wasn\'t like him to dig his heels in, but he felt responsible for the whole thing, and wanted to do what was best for Pitkirtly. In any case, he knew this was the one area of his life where he had any chance of exerting any control; his rôle in the community anchored him, in effect, to the kind of reality he wanted to live in. If he lost that, he would be adrift in an open boat.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'A guerilla campaign,\' said Amaryllis, who had listened intently. This close attention in itself unnerved Christopher, since Amaryllis\'s intentness seemed to him more aggressive than many other people\'s active hostility. \'We\'ll have to fight a guerilla campaign. That\'s what local activists do when they have no power and very few resources.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'Yes, I think some of us know that already,\' said Jock, who before he retired had attempted to teach history to a bunch of ungrateful teenagers who were only interested in themselves. Christopher had often heard him ranting on in this vein, sometimes for hours on end.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'Gorillas? Those big black hairy things they keep in the zoo?\' said the alleged youth worker Darren, perfectly illustrating the point Jock had made on numerous occasions about education being wasted on the young.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jock gave him a quick rundown on the history and logistics of guerilla warfare, while the rest of them talked among themselves about the allotment situation, among other pressing local issues. Mrs Stevenson was particularly vocal on the topic of organic gardeners and their general pickiness and intolerance. They had given up trying to explain it all to her. Amaryllis showed a polite interest and enquired about getting an allotment, but was quickly left with the impression that it was impossible unless your parents had been particularly far-sighted and had put your name down for it well before your birth.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once Christopher called the meeting to order, after a fashion, they talked a bit more about the guerilla campaign.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'You\'re not just using the term in a loose populist sense, meaning a guerilla marketing campaign, are you?\' said Young Dave. \'Only I\'m not that keen on marketing myself.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'Nobody\'s asking you to market yourself!\' said Big Dave scathingly. \'You wouldn\'t get many takers, that\'s for sure!\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'It\'s got nothing to do with marketing,\' said Amaryllis. \'Well - only in the sense that we need to sell people on our own ideas before the Council come along and present their ideas wrapped up with red tape.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'What are our own ideas then?\' said Jock McLean, ever the stirrer.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\'We don\'t need to bother about that yet,\' said Amaryllis airily. \'They can\'t be worse than the ones the faceless apparatchiks at the Council come up with.\'<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christopher noticed how she relished the phrase - it lent a gleeful air to the whole sentence, like a lovely sunrise spreading light and warmth across the earth. He paused for a moment, rewound his thoughts and wondered when he had started to think like a revivalist preacher. He just hoped the tendency hadn\'t come out in his speech too, without him noticing.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amaryllis had discarded a couple of layers of clothing as she became more and more relaxed in the company of PLIF. She was leaning forward slightly to emphasise what she was saying. The sight of her chest in a tight-fitting top seemed almost too much for some of their number. Jock McLean was leaning forward too, and Big Dave, standing over them all as he often did, apparently to emphasise further how much bigger he was than any of them, had bent so far towards her that he almost fell over. Steadying himself he noticed Christopher looking at him, and said gruffly,<p>', 0);

Mate,\" he said, his deep, husky voice ringing in my ears. His hands tightened around me as his forehead came down to meet mine and he breathed in deeply. I let my eyes close as I basked in the feeling of his arms around me and the delicious sparks that were running through my body. I didn\'t even know that it was possible to feel this good. I felt his head move from mine as he nuzzled his nose into my neck. I tilted my head to give him better access and he let out an approving grunt.\r\n\r\nAnd then I felt him place a gentle kiss right where my neck and shoulder met. My knees went weak, my entire body going numb as a breathy sound came from my mouth.
